# JS-Fundamentals - Day 5: Assignment

First assignment of the bootcamp!

As you know, this is not a graded assignment. It's just a project to measure your understandings of the topics so far.

It's something for you, to assess how comfortable you feel with the topics covered this week.

The assignment is nor a guided project nor it is pair programming. You will be on your own.

Feel free to ask for the assistance of the instructor. We encourage you to ask for a review of the instructor once you added a big feature.

In this week's assignment you will build the classic arcade game Pong.

By the end of the day you should try to have all these features:

- Two players can play at the same time. Each one with it's own paddle.
- Keep score. After someone scores it is your choice whether you want to start again or keep playing.
- Increase the speed of the ball if no one scores.

Bonus:

- Keep games score to know who won the match. Similar to Ping Pong Score:

```
A match is played best 3 of 5 games (or 4/7 or 5/9).

For each game, the first player to reach 11 points wins that game,
however a game must be won by at least a two point margin.
```

- Ask for player names at the beginning of the match to congratulate the winner.
- The change of direction when the ball hits the paddle should be different depending on where in the paddle hits. Check different Pong Games online for different options.
